    <h1 class="fw-bold">Five Simple Tips You Can Do to Stay Fit During the Holidays</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="row">

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p class="fw-italic fw-bold text-wrap">Your boss told you to take a few days off. Not to mention, he also included a hefty “bonus” with your pay for the month. As you try to savor the moment, a cold winter breeze blew just over your head. And the familiar scent of pine cones flows playfully through your nasal cavity. It’s the holidays once again. 
        <br><br>
        Each and every one of us has their own interpretation of how the holidays should be celebrated. But, don’t be a hypocrite now and admit it that it’s going to be a marathon of both gastronomic delights and alcoholic abandon.
        <br><br>
        Ok, so you like to party like a rockstar? Check. But, is your health in tune with your jam? With all that pigging out and booze overload, your total health wellness is like Amy Winehouse singing out of tune while choking on her addiction. So much for being a rockstar.</p>
      </div>

    <p class="fw-bold fw-italic">But fret no more. I took you off the hook and did the research for you so you’ll feel like Superman (well, at least, you think you are) after the holiday debauchery.</p>

    <h2>Drink water. Lots of it.</h2>

    <p>The first one on my list is hydration. No. Not that lotion or any of that girly stuff your girlfriend suggested to you. Hydro. That’s water in Latin. Yes. Drink lots of it. Before, in between and after the party. Not only will you eat less but it’ll also lessen the chances of you getting a hangover the next day.</p> 
    
    <h2>Eat something before going to any party.</h2>


    <p>Ok, Aquaman, next on our list is don’t go to the “battle” with an empty stomach. If you do, chances are you’ll look like someone aiming to break the record for the most ravenous bloke on the block. You certainly don’t want to smear your well-guarded reputation with that. At least eat a sandwich prior to the party, for Pete’s sake.</p>
    

  <h2>Hit the sack.</h2>

    <p>Hydration. Check. Full stomach. Done. Next on the list is sleep. Yes, you got that right. How long has it been since you had a full night's sleep? Take advantage of your break and reintroduce yourself to the Sandman. Sleep-deprived people tend to pig out and sloth out more. That’s the kind of animal inside you that you don’t want to wake up now. Let’s close the eye of the tiger for now... to be the tiger! Roar!</p>
    

<h2>Wash your hands and sanitize.</h2>

<p>Wake up, tiger. We’re on to number four now: infection. Hold your horses before you go checking on your partner! Not that kind of infection, at least in a lighter sense. Kiss, hugs, and handshakes are common gestures in social gatherings. But, mind you, they are also a common mode of transmission for bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other unwanted pathogens. Always make sure to wash your hands more often during parties. You won’t be awarded a Nobel prize for it but bringing a handy sanitizer on you (and of course, using it) would make a great difference in lessening the chances of infection among your friends and family. And, also, Einstein, if you’re not feeling well, just don’t attend the party, okay? That’s a better choice than to infect everyone in the party. Take one down for the team!</p>


<h2>Reduce your alcohol consumption.</h2>

<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-6 img2"><img src="img/beer.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="beer"></div>

<div class="col-md-6">
    <p>Finally, here’s the deal-breaker. You need to cut down on your alcohol intake or at least try to be conscious of your calorie intake. It’s ideal to drink 2 glasses of alcohol for women and 3 glasses of alcohol for men per day. But, the weekly threshold is 10 glasses for women and 15 glasses for men. That’s a shame. But liver cirrhosis, high blood pressure, and diabetes aren’t ashamed to take your life either.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Enjoy the Holidays Without Compromising Your Health</h3>

    <p>Now, go and be the party animal that you are; just don’t be the pig or the sloth. These are just tips to staying healthy and fit through the holidays. It all boils down to whether you like to enjoy more holidays in the future or spend it more in the hospital in the years to come. Happy holidays!</p>
