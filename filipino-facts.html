                It’s more fun in the Philippines! That’s the slogan of the Department of Tourism from the Philippines. But, seriously, how fun is it to be in the Philippines? I’m thinking of white, sandy beaches, scenic views, diverse marine life, delicious and exotic foods. . . The list could go on. I think it’s a given fact that the Philippines is a tropical paradise. But, how fun are the Filipinos themselves? Allow me to be your guide to the splendor that is the Filipino people.
                <br><br>
                So, you’re planning to have a vacation or to reside in this tropical wonderland? Before you take the plunge and go gaga, I think you should have some crash course with some common Filipino culture and values first. You will inevitably encounter some or all of these Filipino traits or values during your stay.

        <h2>Utang na Loob</h2>
            <p>
                This is one of the most notable values common to all Filipinos. You do good deeds that could be significant or critical for a Filipino and he will try to return the favor several fold. But, there’s a catch. This so-called gesture of gratitude appears to be payable for the rest of their life. Filipinos would usually go the extra mile to perpetually give back what you have given them. With that in mind, you can get the loyalty of a typical Filipino by helping them when they are in dire need. Just don’t tell them that you heard it from me.

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <h2>Pakikisama</h2>
                <p>
                    This is synonymous with camaraderie. Filipinos, by nature, are like social chameleons. They could easily blend in with the crowd. But, that’s just not plain interaction. The feeling of togetherness and helping one another to achieve a common goal makes this characteristic among Filipinos remarkable. Bonding and unity among communities and groups are further strengthened by the continuous practice of this kind of relationship. There’s no I for this team, mate.
                </p>
            <h2>Filipino Hospitality</h2>
                <p>
                    Another admirable character among Filipinos is their innate nature to be hospitable, especially with foreigners. That’s definitely a plus, right? Yes, they are willing to offer everything they have. Sometimes even compromising their own comfort just to make their guest feel welcomed in their own home. You’ll immediately feel like a member of their household after just a few hours stay with them. As a newcomer to a foreign land, this is a much-welcomed surprise.

        <h2>Filipinos Speak English</h2>
            <p>
                And, last but not the least, the majority of Filipinos know the English language. You won’t have any problems trying to communicate with the locals since many of them have a clear grasp of the language. Nothing feels more comforting than to see someone, in a foreign country, that you can interact with using your native tongue. Say goodbye to getting lost in translation.

        <h3>Filipinos Will Make You Feel Welcomed in Philippines</h3>
            <p>
                Indeed, it’s more fun in the Philippines. But, the positive vibes you could receive from its people won’t make you miss home. It will feel like your second home. Next time you’re planning to visit the Philippines, drop me a line and we could have a beer or two. Let’s both enjoy the unizque scenery and experience that is the Filipino culture.
