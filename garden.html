                        Gardening is as old as mankind. Early humans have learned to segregate useful plants from those that they canâ€™t use. They devised methods to cultivate and harvest these select species of plants. Humans have amassed a plethora of gardening knowledge and techniques through the years. And, gardening is still evolving today.
                        <br><br>
                         Why should you start growing your own garden today? Here are some benefits you could get from gardening.

            <h2>Enjoy the "fruits" of your labor</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">
                 There's nothing more satisfying than to see the product of your hard work. Growing a garden takes time, patience and diligence. But, it's all worth it if you get a sight, taste and smell  of your produce from your own garden.

    <h2> You are contributing to the global initiative of curbing global warming</H2>
    <p>

        Yes, you got that right. Plants help absorb carbon dioxide in the air.  They also absorb carbon monoxide, a toxic fume coming out from an engine's exhaust.  These two are contributing factors in accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Think of your garden as an army of air purifiers.
        
    </p>
    <h2> You'll burn calories while maintaining your garden</h2>
    <p>

        Maintaining a garden is almost synonymous to breaking a sweat.  It depends on how big your garden is and how hands on you are with your garden. By the time you finish trimming and cultivating your garden, you have already lost a few calories.
        
    </p>
        <H2>Gardening promotes good psychological health.</H2>
    <p>

        The sense of fulfillment seeing your plants grow helps reduce stress. It aids in the improvement of mental health. Gardening also increases your patience.
        
        Growing your garden can help reduce the stress from the hustle and bustle of modern life.
    </p>
        
    <H2>Your garden could help you save money.</H2>
    <p>

        Produce from your garden could help lessen your monthly cost with groceries. A garden takes time to grow. But, it's a worthy investment. Yield from your garden could give you sustainable products if done correctly.
        
    </p>
    <H2>Gardens increase your property value.</H2>
 <p>

     Thinking of selling your property in the future? Well, having it in your home could be helpful. A garden increases the selling value of your property. It's like an added bonus to the future buyer of your home. And real estate agents have a knack for increasing the price of property because there's a garden in it.
     
    </p>   
     <H2>Your garden is  your organic food source.</H2>
    <p>

        Most farmers have resorted to the usage of pesticides and other harmful chemicals to keep up with increasing demand. These chemically bombarded fruits and vegetables could cause harmful and long term effects to your body if ingested.
        
        Getting food from your garden gives you the assurance that you are  eating food that is free from pesticides and toxic chemicals. Again, this will have a huge impact on your health.
        
        You're saving money, and at the same time, you are saving your health. Not a bad deal, right?
        
    </p>
    <H3>Go get busy and start building your garden now.</H3>
    <p>

        Growing your own garden is no doubt a good investment for your mind, body and pocket. So, let me rephrase the question, what's stopping you from growing one?
